# Introduction to Database Systems

Material for Carnegie Mellon University's Intro to Database Systems (Fall 2019) 15-445/645

> This course is on the design and implementation of database management systems. Topics include data
> models (relational, document, key/value), storage models (n-ary, decomposition), query languages
> (SQL, stored procedures), storage architectures (heaps, log-structured), indexing (order preserving
> trees, hash tables), transaction processing (ACID, concurrency control), recovery (logging,
> checkpoints), query processing (joins, sorting, aggregation, optimization), and parallel
> architectures (multi-core, distributed). Case studies on open-source and commercial database systems
> are used to illustrate these techniques and trade-offs. The course is appropriate for students with
> lit systems programming skills.
